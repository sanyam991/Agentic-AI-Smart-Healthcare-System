🏥 Agentic AI Smart Healthcare System

The Agentic AI Smart Healthcare System is a next-generation healthcare assistant that leverages multi-agent collaboration and agentic reasoning to provide holistic, personalized, and adaptive wellness solutions.

Unlike traditional health apps that give isolated advice, this system integrates specialized AI agents — Doctor, Nutritionist, Fitness Coach, and Mental Health Expert — that interact, debate, and resolve conflicts through a Resolution Agent powered by CrewAI and LangChain. The result is a unified, balanced health plan tailored to each user’s unique profile.
